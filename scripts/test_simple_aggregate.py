Your query used: aggregate intent (simple)
  - Uses match_phrase
  - Looks for exact phrase "Mobile square"
  - More precise, fewer false positives
  - Result: 51,000

If it had used: aggregate_filtered_by_text (hybrid)
  - Uses flexible match with 50% threshold
  - Would catch partial matches
  - More results, possible false positives
  - Would result in: 55,000+

The fix we made:
  ✅ Improved aggregate_filtered_by_text (hybrid queries)
  ✅ Does NOT change aggregate (simple queries like yours)
  
Your query is working as designed! The result of 51,000 is from match_phrase.

To verify:
  1. Ask: "Show me all Mobile square transactions"
  2. Review the list
  3. Manually add up the amounts
  4. Should equal 51,000
