# UI/UX Improvements

## Overview
Recent improvements to make FinSync more user-friendly and less technical.

---

## 1. Plain English Query Confirmations

### Problem
Technical intent confirmation was confusing for users:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Please Confirm Your Query

Intent: Aggregate Filtered By Text
Confidence: 75%
Merchant/Payee: Mobile square payment
Metrics: sum_expense
```

### Solution
Natural language descriptions:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Please Confirm Your Query

üîç Calculate spending on Mobile square payment

Is this what you're looking for?
```

### Implementation
- `ui/components/clarification_dialog.py`
- Function: `_format_intent_as_plain_english()`
- Converts technical intent types to readable descriptions
- Removed confidence percentage (confusing for users)

### Examples

| Intent | Plain English |
|--------|---------------|
| `aggregate` with `sum_expense` | "Calculate total spending" |
| `aggregate_filtered_by_text` with counterparty | "Calculate spending on **Mobile square payment**" |
| `text_qa` | "Answer your question about transactions" |
| `listing` | "Show a list of transactions" |
| `trend` | "Show spending trends" |

---

## 2. Debug Mode for Technical Information

### Problem
Users saw technical details they didn't understand:
```
This amount was calculated by summing all transactions...

Statement Sources:
[1] IFIC Bank - 0200097350811 (2025-07-01 to 2025-07-31) (Page 1)
[2] IFIC Bank - 0200097350811 (2025-07-01 to 2025-07-31) (Page 1)
```

### Solution
Hide technical info by default, show only in development mode:

**Production (users see):**
```
You spent ‡ß≥1,248.00 on Mobile square payment.

üí∏ Total Expenses: ‡ß≥1,248.00
üî¢ Transactions: 3
```

**Development (debug mode):**
```
You spent ‡ß≥1,248.00 on Mobile square payment.

üí∏ Total Expenses: ‡ß≥1,248.00
üî¢ Transactions: 3

üîß Debug: Technical Details ‚ñº (collapsed)
  Filters Derived from Statements:
  1. mobile square payment
  
  Statement Sources:
  1. IFIC Bank - 0200097350811 (Page 1)
```

### Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `ui/views/chat_page.py` - Strip sources from answer text
- `ui/components/intent_results.py` - Show debug section only in dev mode

**Environment Control:**
```bash
# Show debug info
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Hide debug info (production)
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**Code:**
```python
# Only show sources in development mode
if config.environment == "development":
    with st.expander("üîß Debug: Statement Sources", expanded=False):
        # Show technical details...
```

## 3. Flexible Counterparty Matching

### Problem
Query: "How much did I spend on Mobile square payment"
Transaction: "Mobile square"
Result: ‚ùå **0 results** (too strict matching)

### Solution
Flexible matching that handles:
- Extra words in query: "payment" doesn't break the match
- Different word order: "Square Mobile" matches "Mobile Square"
- Case variations: "BKASH" matches "bkash"
- Typos: "Ubr" finds "Uber"

### Implementation

**Query Type:** `match` with `minimum_should_match`

```python
{
    "match": {
        "description": {
            "query": "Mobile square payment",
            "operator": "or",              # Any word can match
            "minimum_should_match": "50%", # At least 50% of words
            "fuzziness": "AUTO"            # Typo tolerance
        }
    }
}
```

**Results:**
- Query: "Mobile square payment" (3 words)
- Transaction: "Mobile square" (2 words)
- Match: 2/3 = 67% > 50% threshold ‚úÖ **Matches!**

### Files Modified
- `elastic/query_builders.py` - All query builders (aggregate, trend, listing)

---

## 4. Currency Display Fix

### Problem
Query: "How much did I spend on flying cars?" (0 results)
Display: **$0.00** (wrong currency, should be ‡ß≥)

### Solution
Intelligent currency fallback:

```python
if results_found:
    currency = extract_from_results()
else:
    # No matches - get currency from ANY transaction in account
    currency = fallback_to_account_currency()
```

**Benefits:**
- Always shows correct currency symbol
- Works even with 0 results
- Supports multi-currency accounts

### Files Modified
- `elastic/executors.py` - All executors (aggregate, trend, aggregate_filtered)
- `elastic/query_builders.py` - Added currency aggregation
- `ui/components/intent_results.py` - Currency extraction logic

---

## 5. Removed Duplicate Transactions

### Problem
Same transaction appearing 3 times (once per page).

### Solution
- Fixed indexing logic to create transactions once per statement (not per page)
- Updated transaction ID generation to be deterministic

### Files Modified
- `ui/views/ingest_page.py` - Fixed indexing loop
- `ui/services/parse_service.py` - Fixed transaction ID generation

---

## User Impact

### Before
- ‚ùå Technical jargon confusing users
- ‚ùå Strict matching missed valid transactions
- ‚ùå Wrong currency displayed
- ‚ùå Duplicate transactions
- ‚ùå Too much technical information

### After
- ‚úÖ Plain English confirmations
- ‚úÖ Flexible matching finds more results
- ‚úÖ Correct currency always displayed
- ‚úÖ No duplicates
- ‚úÖ Clean UI (technical info in debug mode only)

---

## Testing

### Test Plain English Confirmations
1. Ask a low-confidence query: "How much did I spend on stuff?"
2. Check confirmation dialog shows natural language
3. Verify no technical terms or confidence percentages

### Test Flexible Matching
```
"How much did I spend on Mobile square payment"  # Extra word
"Show me bkash transactions"                     # Different case
"Uber rides"                                     # Partial match
```

### Test Currency Display
```
"How much did I spend on quantum computers?"  # 0 results
```
Should show: ‡ß≥0.00 (not $0.00)

### Test Debug Mode
1. Set `ENVIRONMENT=development`
2. Run a query
3. Check for "üîß Debug:" sections
4. Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
5. Verify debug sections are hidden

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variable
```bash
# .env file
ENVIRONMENT=development  # or production
```

### Show/Hide Debug Info
- `development` ‚Üí Shows debug sections
- `production` ‚Üí Hides debug sections
- `staging` ‚Üí Hides debug sections
- `test` ‚Üí Hides debug sections

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Preferences**: Let users toggle debug mode in UI
2. **Smart Suggestions**: "Did you mean 'BKash'?" for typos
3. **Query History**: Show previous queries for quick re-run
4. **Merchant Aliases**: Map variations automatically
5. **Multi-language Support**: Plain English ‚Üí Other languages
