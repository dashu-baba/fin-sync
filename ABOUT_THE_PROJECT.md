# About FinSync

## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration for FinSync came from a frustrating personal experience. Like many people, I receive monthly bank statements as password-protected PDFs from multiple banks. Trying to answer simple questions like *"How much did I spend on groceries last month?"* or *"What were my largest expenses this year?"* required:

1. **Manual work**: Opening each PDF, copying data to spreadsheets
2. **Categorization**: Manually tagging each transaction
3. **Analysis**: Writing formulas or pivot tables
4. **Time**: Hours of repetitive work every month

I thought: *"Why can't I just ask my bank statements questions like I would ask a financial advisor?"*

That's when I realized the power of combining **Google Cloud's Vertex AI** with **Elastic's hybrid search**. Modern AI can understand unstructured documents AND natural language queries. Elastic's hybrid search can find relevant data through both meaning and exact matches. Together, they could transform how people interact with their financial data.

**FinSync was born from this vision**: *Make financial insights as simple as asking a question.*

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

### Challenge 1: Semantic Filtering + Aggregations

**Problem**: How do you aggregate transactions by semantic meaning?

Traditional approach fails:
- Pure keyword search: "food" doesn't match "Restaurant XYZ"
- Pure semantic search: Returns documents, not sums
- Simple aggregations: Can't filter by meaning

**Our Solution**: Two-phase hybrid approach
1. **Phase 1**: Use vector search to find semantically similar transactions
2. **Phase 2**: Extract merchant names from results
3. **Phase 3**: Use ES|QL to aggregate by those specific merchants

**Mathematical Formulation**:
Let $Q$ be the query embedding, $D$ be the set of all transaction descriptions, and $\text{sim}(Q, d_i)$ be the cosine similarity:

$$\text{Results} = \{d_i \in D \mid \text{sim}(Q, d_i) > \theta\}$$

Then aggregate:

$$\text{Total} = \sum_{t \in \text{Transactions}} \text{amount}(t) \text{ where } \text{description}(t) \in \text{Results}$$

**Impact**: This pattern solved a problem neither system could handle alone. Broadly applicable to any "filter-by-meaning-then-compute" use case.

### Challenge 2: Intent Classification Accuracy

**Problem**: Early versions frequently misclassified queries (40% accuracy).

**Root Causes**:
- Vague category definitions
- Insufficient examples
- No confidence mechanism
- No fallback for ambiguity

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Clear Definitions**: Wrote precise criteria for each intent with examples
2. **Few-Shot Learning**: Provided 3-5 examples per intent in the prompt
3. **JSON Schema Mode**: Forced structured output from Gemini
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Added 0-100 confidence score to classification
5. **Clarification Flow**: If confidence < 75%, ask user for clarification

**Result**: Improved accuracy to 92%+ on test queries.

### Challenge 3: Hybrid Search Tuning

**Problem**: Balancing keyword relevance vs. semantic similarity.

Pure vector search sometimes missed exact keywords (e.g., specific merchant names). Pure keyword search missed semantically related content.

**Solution**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

RRF combines rankings without score normalization:

$$\text{RRF}(d) = \sum_{r \in R} \frac{1}{k + r(d)}$$

Where:
- $R$ = set of rankings (keyword + vector)
- $r(d)$ = rank of document $d$ in ranking $r$
- $k$ = rank constant (we use 60)

**Tuning Process**:
1. Created evaluation set of 50 queries with ground truth
2. Tested values of $k$ from 10 to 100
3. Measured precision@10 and recall@10
4. Found optimal $k = 60$ (balanced keyword and semantic)

**Result**: Hybrid consistently outperformed either approach alone (15-20% improvement in relevance).

### Challenge 4: Document Parsing Robustness

**Problem**: Bank statements have inconsistent formats. Early parsing success rate: 60%.

**Variations Encountered**:
- Multi-line descriptions
- Merged table cells
- Inconsistent date formats
- Missing optional fields
- Different column orders

**Solution Strategy**:
1. **Iterative Prompts**: Refined Gemini prompts based on failure cases
2. **Flexible Schema**: Made optional fields in Pydantic models
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages
4. **Validation**: Multi-stage validation with specific error feedback

**Example Prompt Evolution**:
- **v1**: "Extract transactions from this text"
- **v2**: "Extract transactions. Handle multi-line descriptions by merging them."
- **v3**: "Extract transactions following JSON schema. If a field is missing, use null. Merge multi-line descriptions..."

**Result**: Improved success rate to 95%+.

### Challenge 5: Query Latency

**Problem**: Initial implementation had 8-10 second query latency.

**Bottleneck Analysis**:
- Intent classification: 2-3 seconds (Gemini API)
- Embedding generation: 1-2 seconds (Vertex AI)
- Elastic query: 200-500ms
- Response generation: 2-3 seconds (Gemini API)

**Optimizations**:
1. **Parallel API Calls**: Generate embeddings while classifying intent
2. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse Elasticsearch client connections
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Reduced token count by 40% → faster LLM calls
4. **Model Selection**: Use `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` instead of Pro (3x faster)
5. **Query Optimization**: Use ES|QL instead of multiple DSL queries

**Result**: Reduced median latency to 2-4 seconds (50% improvement).

### Challenge 6: Cost Management

**Problem**: Unoptimized usage could cost $200+/month.

**Cost Analysis**:
- Gemini Pro: $0.0005/1K tokens → $10-20/month for typical usage
- Embeddings: $0.00002/token → $1-2/month
- Cloud Run: Pay-per-use → $3-5/month
- Cloud Storage: $0.02/GB → $0.50/month
- Elastic Cloud: Fixed → Variable based on deployment

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. Use Flash instead of Pro when possible (10x cheaper)
2. Batch embedding generation (reduce API calls)
3. Minimize prompt length (only essential context)
4. Use ES|QL to reduce LLM processing needs
5. Cache Elastic clients (avoid connection overhead)

**Result**: Total GCP cost <$25/month for 100 uploads, 1000 queries.

### Challenge 7: Environment Portability

**Problem**: Local development vs. production differences broke deployments.

**Differences**:
- Storage: Local filesystem vs. GCS
- Secrets: .env files vs. Secret Manager
- Logging: Console vs. Cloud Logging
- URLs: localhost vs. public domain

**Solution**: Abstraction layers with automatic switching

```python
# Storage abstraction
class StorageBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def upload_file(self, file, path): ...
    
# Automatic selection based on environment
def get_storage_backend():
    if config.ENVIRONMENT == "production":
        return GCSStorage()
    return LocalStorage()
```

**Pattern Applied To**:
- Storage (local/GCS)
- Secrets (env/Secret Manager)
- Logging (console/Cloud Logging)

**Result**: Same code runs in dev and prod without changes.

## 📚 What We Learned

### Technical Learnings

#### 1. **LLMs + Structured Systems = Magic**

The biggest learning: **LLMs are not a replacement for traditional databases/search engines - they're a complement.**

- **LLMs excel at**: Understanding intent, extracting meaning, generating natural language
- **Databases excel at**: Structured queries, aggregations, exact matching
- **Together**: Enable capabilities neither can achieve alone

**Example**: "How much did I spend on food?" requires:
- LLM: Understand "food" means restaurants, groceries, cafes (semantic)
- Elastic: Sum transaction amounts (structured aggregation)
- LLM: Compose natural language answer (generation)

#### 2. **Hybrid Search > Pure Approaches**

Tested extensively:
- Keyword-only (BM25): Good for exact matches, misses semantic similarity
- Vector-only (kNN): Good for meaning, misses exact keywords  
- Hybrid (RRF): Consistently 15-20% better on our evaluation set

**Key Insight**: Real-world queries need both precision (exact match) and recall (semantic similarity). RRF elegantly balances them.

#### 3. **Intent Classification is Critical**

Getting the intent right is 80% of the battle. A poor intent classification leads to:
- Wrong query type (aggregation instead of search)
- Missing parameters (forgot to filter by date)
- Confusing responses (answered the wrong question)

**Investment in intent design pays massive dividends in UX.**

#### 4. **Prompt Engineering is an Art**

Writing effective prompts for Gemini required:
- Clear, specific instructions
- Representative examples (few-shot learning)
- Explicit handling of edge cases
- Structured output formats (JSON schema)
- Iterative refinement based on failures

**Example**: Document parsing prompt went through 7 iterations before achieving 95%+ accuracy.

#### 5. **ES|QL is Powerful**

Elastic's ES|QL query language is incredibly expressive for analytics:

```sql
FROM finsync-transactions
| WHERE statementType == "debit" 
  AND statementDate >= "2025-07-01" 
  AND statementDate < "2025-08-01"
| STATS total = SUM(statementAmount) BY accountNo
```

Much cleaner than traditional Elasticsearch DSL and comparable performance.

#### 6. **Cloud-Native from Day One**

Starting with Cloud Run, Secret Manager, and GCS (instead of planning to "migrate later") saved weeks of work. The abstraction layers we built early made development and deployment seamless.

### AI/ML Learnings

#### Vector Embedding Dimensions Matter

Initially tried 256-dim embeddings (faster, cheaper):
- Search quality was poor
- Semantic similarity often missed obvious matches

Switched to 768-dim (text-embedding-004):
- Significantly better semantic understanding
- Worth the extra cost and latency

**Lesson**: Don't over-optimize on dimensions - quality matters more than speed for user experience.

#### Confidence Scoring is Essential

Adding confidence scores to intent classification was transformative:
- Enables fallback behavior (clarification)
- Improves accuracy by knowing when we're uncertain
- Better UX (don't confidently answer wrong question)

**Implementation**: Gemini returns confidence 0-100, we clarify if <75.

#### Few-Shot Learning Works

Providing 3-5 examples per intent in the prompt dramatically improved classification accuracy (from 40% to 92%+). 

**Surprising Finding**: More examples (10+) didn't help much beyond 5. Quality > quantity.

### Software Engineering Learnings

#### Type Safety Saves Time

Using Pydantic for data validation caught dozens of bugs:
- Mismatched field types
- Missing required fields
- Invalid date formats
- Wrong enum values

**ROI**: Extra 2 hours of schema design saved 10+ hours of debugging.

#### Documentation Pays Dividends

Wrote 50+ pages of documentation during development (not after):
- Architecture decisions
- API references
- Implementation guides
- Deployment procedures

**Benefits**:
- Easier onboarding (if team expanded)
- Faster debugging (documented edge cases)
- Better design decisions (writing forces clarity)

#### Test with Real Data Early

Synthetic bank statements looked nothing like real ones:
- Real statements have inconsistent formatting
- Multi-line descriptions are common
- Optional fields are often missing
- Date formats vary

**Lesson**: Get real data ASAP, don't rely on perfect test fixtures.

### Product Learnings

#### Transparency Builds Trust

Users loved seeing:
- Intent classification ("I detected this is an aggregation query")
- Confidence scores ("I'm 87% confident")
- Source citations ("Based on these 5 transactions...")

**Insight**: AI transparency is a feature, not just debugging info.

#### Clarifications > Guessing

When queries were ambiguous, early versions guessed. This was frustrating.

Better: Ask for clarification
- "Did you mean last calendar month or last 30 days?"
- "Which account: Savings or Checking?"

**Users strongly preferred interactive clarification over wrong answers.**

#### Simple Default, Powerful Optional

Two user types emerged:
1. Non-technical users: Want simplicity, don't care about internals
2. Power users: Want control, visibility, debug info

Solution: Progressive disclosure
- Clean interface by default
- Optional debug mode with intent display
- Advanced filters available but hidden

**Both groups happy with same interface.**
