**For**: Architects, senior developers, new team members  
**Contains**: High-level design, data flows, tech decisions

### 2. **Features** - User-Facing Capabilities
**For**: Product managers, users, QA testers  
**Contains**: What the system does, how features work

### 3. **Implementation** - Technical Details
**For**: Developers actively working on code  
**Contains**: Module documentation, code patterns, integration guides

### 4. **Deployment** - Getting to Production
**For**: DevOps, deployment engineers  
**Contains**: Deployment guides, configuration, CI/CD

### 5. **Development** - Local Development
**For**: New developers, contributors  
**Contains**: Setup guides, API docs, testing, contributing

## Benefits

### Before
- ❌ Docs scattered in root and `docs/` folder
- ❌ No clear organization
- ❌ Hard to find relevant documentation
- ❌ Unclear doc hierarchy
- ❌ Implementation mixed with deployment

### After
- ✅ Clear folder-based organization
- ✅ Logical grouping by purpose
- ✅ Easy navigation via docs/README.md
- ✅ Separate concerns (architecture vs implementation vs deployment)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of all aspects

---

## Coverage Summary

| Category | Documents | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Architecture** | 4 | ✅ Complete |
| **Features** | 6 | ✅ Complete |
| **Implementation** | 5 | ✅ Complete |
| **Deployment** | 4 | ✅ Complete |
| **Development** | 4 | ✅ Complete |
| **Total** | **23 documents** | ✅ Complete |
