# FinSync - AI-Powered Personal Financial Assistant

## Project Summary

**FinSync** is an intelligent conversational AI platform that transforms how people manage their personal finances. Users simply upload their bank statements (PDFs), and FinSync automatically parses, understands, and indexes transaction data using **Google Cloud's Vertex AI (Gemini models)** and **Elastic's hybrid search** capabilities. The system enables users to ask natural language questions like *"How much did I spend on groceries last month?"* or *"Show me my biggest expenses"* and receive instant, accurate answers with full context and source citations.

Unlike traditional personal finance apps that require manual data entry or rely on simple keyword matching, FinSync combines **semantic understanding** (through vector embeddings), **powerful analytics** (through Elastic's ES|QL engine), and **conversational AI** (through Gemini) to create an intelligent agent that truly understands financial queries and provides actionable insights.

## Challenge Addressed

**Elastic Challenge**: Build the Future of AI-Powered Search

FinSync directly addresses this challenge by:

1. **Hybrid Search Implementation**: Combines Elastic's BM25 keyword search with kNN vector search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to find relevant transactions through both exact matches and semantic similarity.

2. **Conversational AI Interface**: Users interact naturally without learning complex query syntax. The AI understands intent, extracts parameters, and routes queries to optimal search strategies.

3. **Agent-Based System**: An intelligent intent classification system acts as an AI agent, automatically determining whether to use aggregations, semantic search, or hybrid approaches based on query type.

4. **Real-World Impact**: Reimagines personal finance management by making financial data accessible through conversation rather than spreadsheets and dashboards.

## Data Sources

### Primary Data Source
**User-Uploaded Bank Statements (PDF)**
- Password-protected PDF files from various banks
- Contain transaction history (credits, debits, balances)
- Include account metadata (bank name, account number, dates)
- Unstructured format requiring AI parsing

### Derived Data

**Structured Transaction Data** (extracted by Gemini):
```json
{
  "accountName": "John Doe",
  "accountNo": 123456789,
  "accountType": "Savings",
  "statementFrom": "2025-01-01",
  "statementTo": "2025-01-31",
  "bankName": "ABC Bank",
  "statements": [
    {
      "statementDate": "2025-01-02",
      "statementAmount": 5000.00,
      "statementType": "credit",
      "statementDescription": "Salary Deposit - ABC Corp",
      "statementBalance": 12500.00,
      "statementNotes": "Monthly salary"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Semantic Embeddings** (generated by text-embedding-004):
- Transaction descriptions vectorized into 768-dimensional embeddings
- Enables semantic search (e.g., "groceries" matches "supermarket", "food mart")
- Indexed in Elastic's dense_vector field type

### Data Flow

2. **Extract**: PyPDF2 extracts raw text from PDF
3. **Parse**: Gemini converts unstructured text to structured JSON
4. **Embed**: Vertex AI generates vector embeddings for descriptions
5. **Index**: Both structured data and embeddings indexed to Elastic
6. **Query**: User asks question ‚Üí Hybrid search retrieves relevant data
7. **Answer**: Gemini generates natural language response with citations

## Findings and Learnings

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### 1. **Semantic Filtering for Aggregations**

**Challenge**: Traditional search engines struggle with queries like *"How much did I spend on food?"* because:
- "food" doesn't exactly match "Restaurant XYZ" or "Grocery Store ABC"
- Simple keyword search misses semantically related transactions
- Pure semantic search returns documents, not aggregated sums

**Solution**: Two-phase hybrid approach
1. **Phase 1**: Use Elastic's vector search to find semantically similar transactions (kNN with `text-embedding-004`)
2. **Phase 2**: Extract merchant names from results, then use ES|QL to aggregate by those specific merchants
3. **Result**: Accurate aggregations that understand *meaning*, not just keywords

**Key Learning**: Combining semantic and structured queries solves problems neither can handle alone. This pattern is broadly applicable to any "filter-then-aggregate" use case.

#### 2. **Intent Classification Accuracy**

**Challenge**: Determining user intent from natural language is non-trivial. Early versions frequently misclassified queries, leading to wrong query types and poor results.

**Solution**: Structured prompt engineering with examples
- Provided Gemini with clear intent definitions and 3-5 examples per intent
- Used JSON schema mode for consistent output format
- Added confidence scoring to trigger clarifications when uncertain
- Implemented interactive clarification flow for ambiguous queries

**Key Learning**: LLMs excel at classification when given:
- Clear, distinct categories with specific criteria
- Representative examples covering edge cases
- Structured output formats (JSON schema)
- Fallback mechanisms for uncertainty

#### 3. **Hybrid Search Optimization**

**Challenge**: Balancing semantic relevance with exact matches. Pure vector search sometimes missed exact keywords; pure keyword search missed semantically similar content.

**Solution**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
- Run both BM25 (keyword) and kNN (vector) searches in parallel
- Use Elastic's RRF to combine rankings
- Tune `rank_constant` (60) based on evaluation

**Key Learning**: Hybrid search consistently outperforms either approach alone. The RRF algorithm elegantly handles different score scales without normalization.

#### 4. **Document Parsing Robustness**

**Challenge**: Bank statements vary wildly in format across institutions. Early parsing attempts frequently failed or produced incomplete data.

**Solution**: Iterative prompt refinement
- Started with basic extraction prompt
- Added specific instructions for handling edge cases (merged cells, multi-line descriptions, missing fields)
- Made optional fields in Pydantic schema to handle variations
- Implemented validation with helpful error messages

**Key Learning**: Gemini's multimodal capabilities are powerful but require:
- Clear, specific instructions
- Examples of desired output format
- Flexible schemas that accommodate real-world variations
- Iterative refinement based on failure cases

#### 5. **Elastic Index Design**

**Challenge**: Should we use one index or multiple? What fields should be vectors vs. keywords?

**Solution**: Two-index strategy
- **`finsync-transactions`** (Data Stream): Individual transactions for ES|QL aggregations
- **`finsync-statements`** (Vector Index): Statement-level data for hybrid search

**Key Learning**: Index design should match query patterns:
- Use data streams for time-series data with frequent aggregations
- Use separate vector indices when semantic search is primary use case
- Keep indices focused and optimized for specific access patterns

#### 6. **Cost Management**

**Challenge**: Vertex AI and Elastic Cloud have usage-based pricing. Unoptimized usage could become expensive.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Use `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` instead of Pro for most tasks (10x cheaper)
- Batch embedding generation for multiple descriptions
- Cache Elastic client connections (don't recreate on every request)
- Minimize prompt length by removing redundant context
- Use ES|QL instead of multiple Elasticsearch queries

**Cost Impact**: Kept monthly GCP costs under $25 for typical usage (100 uploads, 1000 queries)

**Key Learning**: LLM cost optimization is critical:
- Choose appropriate models for each task
- Minimize token usage without sacrificing quality
- Use structured queries (ES|QL) to reduce LLM processing
- Monitor usage with Cloud Logging

#### 7. **Production Deployment**

**Challenge**: Local development vs. production environment differences (storage, secrets, logging).

**Solution**: Environment-aware configuration
- Created abstraction layer for storage (`core/storage.py`)
- Automatic backend switching based on `ENVIRONMENT` variable
- GCP Secret Manager integration for production secrets
- Unified logging that works locally and in Cloud Run

**Key Learning**: Design for portability from day one:
- Abstract external dependencies behind interfaces
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Test both local and cloud scenarios
- Build deployment automation early (don't wait for "production-ready")

#### 8. **User Experience**

**Challenge**: Technical users want control; non-technical users want simplicity.

**Solution**: Progressive disclosure
- Simple chat interface by default
- Optional "debug mode" shows intent classification and confidence
- Interactive clarifications when needed
- Plain English confirmations and error messages

**Key Learning**: Great UX for AI apps means:
- Transparency when needed (show reasoning)
- Simplicity by default (hide complexity)
- Graceful degradation (clarify instead of failing)
- Clear feedback on what the system is doing

### Performance Insights

**Document Processing**: 3-8 seconds per PDF (mostly Gemini parsing time)
**Query Latency**: 
- Simple aggregations: <500ms
- Hybrid search: 1-2 seconds
- Complex text_qa: 2-4 seconds

**Bottlenecks Identified**:
1. Gemini API calls (network + processing)
2. Embedding generation for long descriptions
3. Large result set processing

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Implement response caching for common queries
- Batch embed generation during indexing
- Use Gemini's streaming API for faster perceived performance
- Add Redis cache layer for frequent aggregations

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **ES|QL for Analytics**: Fast, powerful, and expressive. Much better than traditional Elasticsearch DSL for aggregations.

2. **Gemini's JSON Mode**: Reliable structured output made intent parsing and document extraction robust.

3. **Streamlit for Rapid Iteration**: Built complete UI in days, not weeks. Session state management is excellent.

4. **Cloud Run Serverless**: Zero-configuration auto-scaling. Perfect for this use case.

5. **Hybrid Search**: Consistently better results than either keyword or semantic search alone.

### What Was Harder Than Expected

1. **Query Ambiguity**: Natural language is inherently ambiguous. Clarification flow was necessary but complex to implement.

2. **PDF Format Variations**: Every bank has different statement layouts. Required extensive prompt engineering.

3. **Embedding Dimensionality**: Initially tried 256-dim embeddings (faster/cheaper) but quality was poor. Switched to 768-dim with significant improvement.

4. **Date Handling**: Users say "last month" but system needs exact dates. Implemented date parsing logic but edge cases remain.

5. **Testing with Real Data**: Synthetic data doesn't capture real-world variations. Needed actual bank statements for meaningful testing.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Combine LLMs with Structured Systems**: LLMs excel at understanding intent and generating responses. Traditional databases (Elastic) excel at structured queries and aggregations. The combination is more powerful than either alone.

2. **Invest in Intent Classification**: Getting intent right is 80% of the battle. A good intent system dramatically improves user experience.

3. **Hybrid Search is Essential**: For real-world search applications, hybrid (keyword + semantic) consistently outperforms pure approaches.

4. **Start with Simple, Add Complexity**: Initial version had one intent type. We evolved to five specialized intents based on usage patterns.

5. **User Feedback Drives Design**: Clarification flow came from watching users struggle with ambiguous queries. Debug mode came from power users wanting visibility.

6. **Cloud-Native from Day One**: Starting with Cloud Run, Secret Manager, and GCS saved weeks of refactoring later.

7. **Documentation Matters**: Comprehensive docs (50+ pages) made team collaboration seamless and debugging faster.
